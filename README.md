# Car Sales Analysis using SQL & Power BI

A data analytics project that showcases my skills in data transformation, visualization, and insight generation using **MySQL** and **Power BI**.

---

## Project Overview

This project analyzes car sales data with multiple dimensions including brand, model, price, customer demographics, and dealer info. The goal is to uncover business insights and build a scalable **star schema model** for reporting.

---

## Tools Used

- **MySQL** – for data cleaning, transformation, and splitting normalized tables.
- **Power BI** – for building an interactive dashboard and data model.
- **Excel** – used briefly for intermediate file exports.
- **DAX** – to create dynamic measures like KPIs and most expensive car logic.

---

## Data Model (Star Schema)

- `car_info` – center fact table
- `brand_info` – dimension (Car brand and image)
- `dealer_info` – dimension (Dealer details)
- `sales_info` – dimension (Customer and transaction details)

---

## Key Features

- KPI cards: Total Sales, Most Expensive Car Sold, Top Brand
- Slicers for Brand, Transmission, Color
- Dynamic insights based on filters
- Body style preferences by gender
- Images of top car models

---

## Key Learnings

- Implemented **star schema** for performance
- Used **ALLSELECTED() and DAX** for dynamic metrics
- Connected SQL output directly to Power BI for smooth workflow
- Simulated a real-world business dashboard use case
