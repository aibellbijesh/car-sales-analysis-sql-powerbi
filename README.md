# Car Sales Analysis using SQL & Power BI

A data analytics project that showcases my skills in data transformation, visualization, and insight generation using **MySQL** and **Power BI**.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes car sales data with multiple dimensions including brand, model, price, customer demographics, and dealer info. The goal is to uncover business insights and build a scalable **star schema model** for reporting.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **MySQL** – for data cleaning, transformation, and splitting normalized tables.
- **Power BI** – for building an interactive dashboard and data model.
- **Excel** – used briefly for intermediate file exports.
- **DAX** – to create dynamic measures like KPIs and most expensive car logic.
